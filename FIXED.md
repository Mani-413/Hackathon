# ✅ All Errors Fixed!

## What Was Fixed

1. **Backend Server Issue:** Created a standalone server (`server-standalone.js`) that uses only Node.js built-in modules
   - ✅ No npm dependencies required
   - ✅ No installation needed
   - ✅ Works immediately

2. **Frontend Server:** Already running on port 8000

3. **Both Servers:** Now running successfully!

## Current Status

✅ **Backend:** http://localhost:3000 - RUNNING  
✅ **Frontend:** http://localhost:8000 - RUNNING  
✅ **Website:** Fully functional!

## How to Start (Next Time)

### Option 1: Use Standalone Server (Recommended - No npm needed)
```bash
cd backend
node server-standalone.js
```

### Option 2: Use Batch File
Double-click `start-backend.bat` - it will automatically use the standalone server if dependencies aren't installed.

### Option 3: Use Express Server (if npm works)
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```
